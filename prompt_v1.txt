Here is a Spanish word. If it is a verb, I want you to provide its conjugations in the following tenses: present indicative, preterite indicative, perfect indicative. However, keep the following in mind: only provide conjugations that are irregular. If all conjugations are regular for a given verb and tense, then simply provide a dash. 

For all words (including verbs) I want you to include simple example sentences where they are applied. You decide on the number of example sentences. This number should be based on the number of ways that a word can be applied. For example, "pasar" has many meanings and will therefore have many example sentences whereas "computador" can mean very few things. 

Example with word "computador (nm)" ###
I have very much and such -- This is the english translation
I have very much and such -- This is the english translation
I have very much and such -- This is the english translation
