Below is a Spanish word. Please follow these instructions carefully to generate your response:

1. For all words (including verbs):
    a. Provide simple example sentences demonstrating the different meanings or contexts in which the word is used.
    b. The number of example sentences should match the number of distinct meanings the word can have, but keep it to a minimum to avoid clutter. This number should be based on the number meanings that a word can have, depending on its context. For example, "tener" can be used to express possession, age, obligation, desire, and physical states. Therefore, "tener" should contain a single example sentence for each of these meanings. "Computador", on the other hand, can only mean computer and should therefore be accompanied by a single example sentence.

2. If the word is a verb:
    a. After the example sentences, provide its conjugations in the following tenses:
            i. Indicative Present
            ii. Indicative Preterite
            iii. Indicative Imperfect
